### üì¶ Simple Inventory Management App 

Invo is an inventory management app designed to make managing product stocks easier. Developed as an internship project under ASElab, this app allows users to log in, add new products to their inventory, and track the in-and-out movements of goods in storage. Built using Flutter, Invo features an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Due to the absence of a backend developer in our team, the app is currently available only in its front-end version. Despite this limitation, Invo still provides a practical solution for everyday storage management needs. I contributed significantly to the UI/UX design and the majority of the coding.
